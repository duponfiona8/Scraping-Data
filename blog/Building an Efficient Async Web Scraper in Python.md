# Building an Efficient Async Web Scraper in Python

When developing a web scraper, speed and efficiency are critical, especially when dealing with multi-level scraping processes. Using asynchronous programming in Python can significantly improve performance by allowing you to make non-blocking HTTP requests. This article walks through the structure and implementation of an async scraper using Python's `asyncio` and `httpx` libraries, while addressing common challenges and offering optimization tips.

## How the Async Scraper Works

This scraper is designed to crawl multiple levels of web pages, gather links from each level, and recursively process those links. Here's the high-level breakdown:

1. **Asynchronous HTTP Requests**: The scraper uses `httpx.AsyncClient` to perform non-blocking requests, ensuring it doesn't waste time waiting for responses.
2. **Recursive Scraping**: Each scraped page produces links to further pages, which are added to a task queue for processing.
3. **Worker System**: Multiple workers are created to process tasks in parallel, improving overall efficiency.

### Core Components of the Scraper

#### Task Specification and Result Classes

To manage tasks and their results, the scraper uses two custom classes:

```python
@dataclass
class TaskSpec:
    func: Callable
    args: list = field(default_factory=list)
    kwargs: dict = field(default_factory=dict)

@dataclass
class TaskResult:
    result: Any
    new_tasks: list[TaskSpec] = field(default_factory=list)
```

- **`TaskSpec`**: Encapsulates the function to be executed, along with its arguments and keyword arguments.
- **`TaskResult`**: Stores the result of a task and any new tasks generated from it.

#### Page-Specific Functions

Each function corresponds to a scraping task for a specific page level:

```python
async def get_page_1(url: str, client: httpx.AsyncClient):
    response = await client.get(url)
    content = BeautifulSoup(response.content, features="lxml")
    # Process the content and gather links for the next level
    new_jobs = [TaskSpec(get_page_2, (new_url, client)) for new_url in links]
    return TaskResult(result, new_jobs)
```

- `get_page_2` and `get_page_3` follow a similar pattern, handling their respective levels of scraping.

#### Task Queue and Worker Processing

The task queue is processed by workers, each running asynchronously:

```python
async def process_queue(queue: asyncio.Queue, result_set: list):
    while True:
        try:
            spec: TaskSpec = await queue.get()
            result: TaskResult = await spec.func(*spec.args, **spec.kwargs)

            for new_task in result.new_tasks:
                queue.put_nowait(new_task)

            result_set.append(result.result)
        except httpx.ReadTimeout:
            print("Request timed out. Re-adding task to queue...")
            queue.put_nowait(spec)
        except Exception as e:
            pass
        finally:
            queue.task_done()
```

- Tasks that fail due to timeouts are re-added to the queue for retrying.

#### Main Function

The main function initializes the task queue, workers, and HTTP client:

```python
async def main():
    queue = asyncio.Queue()
    result_set = []

    num_workers = 20
    httpx_limits = httpx.Limits(max_connections=num_workers)

    async with httpx.AsyncClient(timeout=10, limits=httpx_limits) as client:
        for url in urls:
            queue.put_nowait(TaskSpec(get_page_1, (url, client)))

        workers = [asyncio.create_task(process_queue(queue, result_set)) for _ in range(num_workers)]

        await queue.join()

    for worker in workers:
        worker.cancel()
    await asyncio.gather(*workers, return_exceptions=True)
```

- Workers process tasks until the queue is empty, after which they are canceled.

## Addressing Key Challenges

### Re-Queuing Failed Tasks

The `TaskSpec` class simplifies the process of re-queuing failed tasks, particularly when dealing with timeouts or other transient errors. This design allows the task functions (`get_page_1`, `get_page_2`, etc.) to remain decoupled from the queue logic, improving code clarity and maintainability.

### Optimizing Worker Count

Using 20 workers strikes a balance between efficiency and avoiding excessive `httpx.ReadTimeout` errors. Increasing the worker count may lead to diminishing returns due to bandwidth or processing limitations. If you want to scale further:

- Consider optimizing your internet connection or using a proxy solution like [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/?fp_ref=coupons).
- Profile your scraper to identify bottlenecks in parsing or task handling.

### Managing Results Without Global Variables

The `result_set` list is passed to the `process_queue` function for storing task results. While this approach works, it's not the most Pythonic. Alternatives include:

- Using a thread-safe data structure like `asyncio.Queue` to collect results.
- Returning results from the `process_queue` function using `asyncio.gather`.

### Understanding `httpx.ReadTimeout` Errors

These errors typically occur when the server takes too long to respond or the local processing creates delays in handling responses. Solutions include:

- Increasing the `timeout` parameter in `httpx.AsyncClient`.
- Reducing the complexity of parsing operations to return control to the event loop faster.
- Using better proxies or optimizing network conditions.
