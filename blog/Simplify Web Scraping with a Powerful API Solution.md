# Simplify Web Scraping with a Powerful API Solution

---

## Powered by Ethical Mobile Proxies

When you use our API, you tap into the power of **high-quality, ethically sourced proxies**. Unlike other web scraping providers, we include these proxies by default at no extra cost or additional configuration. 

### Why Choose Ethical Proxies?
Many scraping services and proxy providers resort to unethical practices to acquire IPs. By choosing ethical proxies, you avoid contributing to these questionable methods. All our IPs are responsibly sourced. [Learn more about our approach](https://scrapingfish.com/how-ips-for-web-scraping-are-sourced).
