# How to Use Google Sheets to Scrape Amazon and Walmart Product Data

## Introduction

Recently, I came across an incredible video while browsing Twitter:

The video demonstrated how you could input a product link from Amazon into Excel and directly retrieve product details such as title, price, and more. Essentially, it acts as an Amazon scraper, allowing you to fetch product information to your spreadsheet by simply knowing the ASIN.

I decided to test it out, and here's what I found. First, you'll need to use [Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) and install the [ImportFromWeb](https://workspace.google.com/marketplace/app/importfromweb_web_scraping_in_google_she/278587576794) plugin. Without this plugin, you wonâ€™t have access to the required functions. 

### Getting Started
- **Product Link Formula:**  
  Combine `https://www.amazon.com/dp/` with the product's ASIN to create the product link.  
- **Plugin Installation:**  
  Install the ImportFromWeb plugin to enable scraping functionalities.  

Once everything is set up, it works just like the video showed. Sometimes the data takes a moment to load, but it retrieves the product details accurately.
