## Prerequisites for Scraping eBay

eBay can be scraped directly without any special configurations or the need for VPNs or proxies. However, using a US-based proxy can improve the speed if you're experiencing slow website access.

### Tips for a Better Experience:
- **Region Settings:** eBay automatically translates pages based on your IP location. If you need English-language results, use a US-based IP. Alternatively, access eBay via a browser, change the language to English and set the region to your target market before starting the scraping process.

## Adding URLs for Scraping

To scrape product data, you can either enter keywords like "shoes" directly into the software or copy the search results URL from eBay. Here's how:

1. **Search on eBay:** Use eBay's search bar to find products (e.g., "shoes").
2. **Copy the URL:** Copy the search results page URL.

Below is an example of how to paste the URL into the scraping tool and start collecting data.

Simply wait for the process to complete. If you want to scrape additional product details such as high-resolution images, descriptions, color options, or sizes, you can start a **Details Scraping Task** once the initial scraping is finished.

You can pause or stop tasks at any time during the scraping process. After completion, export the data to your preferred format.

## Setting the eBay Language

eBay automatically adjusts language based on IP. To modify the language settings:
1. Use a US-based IP to ensure English results.
2. Alternatively, manually change the language settings in your browser.
