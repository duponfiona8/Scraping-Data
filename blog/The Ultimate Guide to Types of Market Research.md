## Types of Market Research

There are several types of market research, each with unique advantages and drawbacks. Letâ€™s explore them in detail:

### 1. Primary Research

**Primary research** involves collecting **first-party data** directly from the source. This is one of the most accurate and cost-effective forms of market research.

#### Methods for Collecting Primary Data:
- **Surveys**: Distribute pre-written questions to customers or potential clients.
- **Interviews**: Conduct Q&A sessions with individuals or small groups, often in person.
- **Focus Groups**: Pose questions to a group representing different customer demographics.
- **Observations**: Impartially observe interactions or events without direct engagement.

### 2. Secondary Research

**Secondary research** uses data from external sources such as:
- Published studies
- Government records
- Media (e.g., newspapers, blogs)

This method is quicker but may have limitations since you aren't interacting directly with the subjects. It is often used to form a foundation for primary research.

### 3. Quantitative Research

**Quantitative research** involves systematically collecting numerical data to identify trends, measure market size, and analyze changes over time. It provides benchmarks and uses statistical analysis to draw conclusions.

Qualitative research complements quantitative data by offering context and deeper insights.
