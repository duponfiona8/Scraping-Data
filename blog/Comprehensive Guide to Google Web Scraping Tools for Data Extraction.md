## Understanding Web Scraping

Web scraping is the process of extracting data from websites in an automated manner. Itâ€™s commonly used to collect information from online platforms, including social media, directories, and search engines like Google.

### HTML and the DOM

Web pages are written in **HTML (HyperText Markup Language)**, which structures the content on a page. When a browser loads a page, it creates a **Document Object Model (DOM)**, a tree-like structure representing the web page's content. Web scrapers navigate and extract data by interacting with the DOM.

### Legal Considerations in Web Scraping

The legality of web scraping depends on the website's terms of service and the type of data being extracted. Websites may explicitly prohibit scraping or impose limitations in their terms of use. It's important to:

- Avoid scraping personal identifiable information (PII).
- Respect website terms and comply with ethical scraping practices.
