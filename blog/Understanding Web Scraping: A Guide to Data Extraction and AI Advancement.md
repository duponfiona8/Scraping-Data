## How Does Web Scraping Work?

A web scraper automates the process of extracting information from websites and delivers it in a structured format, such as JSON or CSV. This process relies on two key components: a **web crawler** and a **web scraper**.

### The Web Crawler

Often called a "spider," the crawler navigates the internet, indexing content and discovering URLs. It leads the scraper to the data you want to extract.

### The Web Scraper

The scraper retrieves specific data from the web pages identified by the crawler. Using technologies like XPath, CSS selectors, or regular expressions, the scraper pinpoints and extracts the desired information.

## Web Scraping vs. Web Crawling

While web scraping focuses on extracting data, web crawling is about discovering and indexing content. Both work in tandem to enable efficient data collection.

## DIY Web Scraping: A Step-by-Step Guide

For small-scale projects, you can use open-source tools to scrape websites. Hereâ€™s what a typical process looks like:

1. Identify the target website.
2. Collect URLs of the target pages.
3. Send requests to these URLs to retrieve HTML.
4. Use locators (e.g., XPath, CSS) to extract data from the HTML.
5. Save the data in a structured format like JSON or CSV.

While this approach is feasible for small projects, scaling up presents challenges, such as managing proxies, handling CAPTCHAs, and maintaining scrapers when website layouts change.
